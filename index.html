        <h2>Python Genius Hour Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/course/cs0-21">Python Cmu</a></p>
        <p>This project is something I coded using Python.  My goal was to have gears that rotate at different speeds to make it look realistic.  It took a lot of trial and error, but I was eventually able to perfect the movement of the gears.  I ultimately learned how to animate pictures to make them look more interesting.</p>

        <h2>Personal Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/course/cs0-21">Python Cmu</a></p>
        <p>This project is a lantern I coded using Python.  My goal was to use different shapes and gradients to create a picture of an illuminated lantern.  I accomplished my goal by using a bunch of different shapes and creative thinking.  I learned how to use different shapes, borders, and lines to create a picture.</p>

        <h2>Snap Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/">Snap Project</a></p>
        <p>This project is a shopping list I programmed using Snap! Software. My goal was to be able to add items to the list, clear the list, and delete specific items off the list.  I was able to accomplish this by using various Snap! variables and trying different things.  I learned about how to use the ask and answer variables on Snap! to create a realistic shopping list.

        <h2>Favicon Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://code.org/">Favicon Project</a></p>
        <p>I coded this candy cane using the pixelation widget on code.org.  My goal was to use binary to code different colored pixels to create a picture.  I learned how to use the pixelation widget  to use binary and hex to create pictures.</p>

        <h2>Drawing App Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=abance&ProjectName=Build-A-Car">Build-A-Car</a></p>
        <p>Me and my partner Rohan coded this drawing app and took inspiration from something we both enjoy learning about: cars.  We built this app because we thought it would be interesting to be able to use different customizations to create unique cars.  The purpose of the program is to be able to design different cars that have their own unique color combinations and features such as a spoiler.
